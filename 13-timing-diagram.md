## Introduction

Emphasizes on the timing and sequencing of messages or events in a system

Model the behavior of objects or components **over a certain period of time** and to depict the order in which
events occur in a system

Timing diagram primarily focuses on time

## Basics of Timing Diagram

**Lifeline**

Depicts a single element within the interaction

Represents a singular entity that plays a role in the interaction and is labeled by the classifier's name it signifies

**State / Condition timeline**

Represents the set of valid states the object goes through

**Message**

Represents the communication or interaction between two objects or components state

**Message Constraints**

Duration Constraint: Constraint of an interval

Time Constraint: Constraint of an interval
